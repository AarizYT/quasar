Installing Extensions
=============================

Extensions for the Data Server, which comes in the form of a ``.dll`` or ``.so`` file, can be installed by placing the file in the ``extensions`` directory where the Quasar executable is installed or extracted. For installations on Windows, this is typically ``C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Local\Quasar\Release\extensions\``.

Windows users can also install extensions to ``%AppData%\quasar\extensions\``.
