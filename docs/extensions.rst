Installing Extensions
=============================

Extensions for the Data Server, which comes in the form of a ``.dll`` or ``.so`` file, can be installed by placing the file in the ``extensions`` directory where the Quasar executable is installed. On Windows, this is typically ``C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Local\Programs\Quasar\extensions\``.

Windows users can also install extensions to ``C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Roaming\quasar\extensions\``.
