Installing Extensions
=============================

Extensions for the Data Server, which comes in the form of a ``.dll`` or ``.so`` file, should typically be installed to Quasar's data folder. On Windows, this is at ``%AppData%\quasar\extensions\``. You can access this folder by clicking on **Open Data Folder** in Quasar's tray icon menu.

Extensions can also be installed by placing the file in the ``extensions`` directory where the Quasar executable is installed or extracted. For installations on Windows, this is typically ``C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Local\Quasar\Release\extensions\``.
