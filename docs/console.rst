A new feature in version 2.0 of Quasar is the addition of the Debug/Developer Console.

This console allows extension and widget developers to test queries and sample outputs without having to write a test widget or log JavaScript.

Simply write the query on the left, click Send, and the resulting output from Quasar will be displayed on the right.
