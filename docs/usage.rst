Basic Usage
==================

Loading a Widget
------------------

Right-click the Quasar icon in your notification bar, and click **Load**. Browse to the folder containing the widget, and load the ``.json`` Widget Definition file. If the widget folder does not contain a Widget Definition ``.json`` file, then it is not compatible with Quasar.

The loaded widget will then appear on your desktop.

Moving a Widget
---------------

Widgets can be moved simply by dragging them around.

Closing a Widget
------------------

Right-click the widget on your desktop, and click **Close**. If the widget is no longer visible for whatever reason, the widget menu can be accessed by right-clicking the Quasar icon in your notification bar, under the **Widgets** menu.
